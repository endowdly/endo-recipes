# Ryan's Recipes

A repo to build a simple desktop-based website to view some of my favorite recipes.

## Recipe Cards

Recipe cards are stored in `src` as markdown files.

## Github Pages

When a new markdown file is added and pushed to the repo, Github Actions will build a new page.
The recipe page should be up-to-date!
The recipes page is built and stored [here](https://endowdly.github.io/endo-recipes/recipes.html).

## Manual Build

Clone to the `retain-manual` branch and run `build.bat`.

Build Requirements:
