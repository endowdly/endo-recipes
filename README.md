# Ryan's Recipes

A repo to build a simple desktop-based website to view some of my favorite recipes.

## Readme

Open recipes.html to view a document of the recipes.

The recipes.html file should be up-to-date.
If it is not, build the page by opening `build.bat`.

Build Requirements:

- Win 10
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Pandoc version 2.10.1 or later

Recipe cards are stored in the src directory as markdown files.
