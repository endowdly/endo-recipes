RYAN'S KIMCHI JIGAE 
===================

A korean braised stew.

When I was little, my mother was a waitress at a Japanese and Korean karaoke bar and restaurant.
She would often bring me and let the cooks in the back watch me while she worked.
This is a traditional and simple stew I came up with as an homage to the yori girls at [Suki's](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/749740984241488064/970048854516965376/sukisAd1987Trim.png).
It features pork and kimchi.

I make my own stock for the stew, and you should too.

You can make your own kimchi, but that won't be covered here.
Make sure you buy authentic kimchi and get a lot.
The funkier it is, the better.

One last note, and the most important:
I always adjust the seasoning (usually adding more).

Like [Uncle Roger says](https://giphy.com/clips/mrnigelng-cooking-show-uncle-roger-5HDCKts1Re8NxcwTSq), "just use feeling".

_4 servings_

Stock Parts
-----------

- 7 large dried anchovies
- 1/3 cup korean radish
- 4 pieces of dried kelp roughly 5 sq inches
- 4 cups water

Stew Parts
----------

- 1 lb kimchi
- 1/4 cup kimchi brine (from the jar)
- 1/2 lb pork shoulder or pork belly
- 6-8 oz of firm tofu
- 3 green onions
- 1 medium onion
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons gochugaru (korean pepper flakes)

Prep
----

1. Pour out some kimchi brine.
2. Cut the kimchi into bite sized pieces.
3. Cut the pork how you would like.
4. Slice the medium onion.
Save the root and skin.
5. Thinly slice the radish.
6. If the anchovies are whole, remove the guts (heads are optional, but I keep them on).
7. Cut the tofu into strips or bite-sized pieces.
8. Cut off the green onion roots.
9. Thinly slice one of the green onion tops longways into long strips.
Then place the strips into a bowl of cold water, letting them soak for at least 5 minutes.
We will call these sexy scallions.
10. Slice the other green onion tops at a bias. Or not, it's whatever.
We will call these scallions (not sexy).

Cooking the Stock

Want more favor?
Cook longer.
5. Strain out the solids using a fine mesh strainer or sieve.

Stew
----

1. Put the kimchi and the brine into a shallow pot or deep pan.
Put the pork, the scallions, and sliced onion on top of the kimchi.

Put the pepper paste on top.
Drizzle the sesame oil evenly over everything in the pan.
2. Carefully pour the anchovy stock into the pan and fill just below halfway.
3. Cover and cook for 10 minutes over medium high heat or until the port is cooked through (use feeling).
4. Open and mix the stew. Lay the tofu on top.
5. Cover and cook another 10 to 15 minutes until stew is reduced and well combined.
6. Remove sexy scallions from water and pat dry.
Remove stew from heat and cover with sexy scallions.
