CARNITAS
========

These are bastardized carnitas.
Traditional carnitas are usually tenderized in lard; a big pork confit.
Since a large amount of lard can be hard to come by, I make this beer-braised version.
Carnitas are commonly served up in tacos, so here I serve mine in homemade flour tortillas with traditional garnish.

I recommend using Ancho over fresh Poblano for their roasted flavor.

4. Halve the onion and then thinly slice.

5. Chop the garlic roughly.

Cook
-----

1. Put chiles in a medium bowl.
Add enough boiling water to cover chiles and set a small plate on bowl to keep chiles under water.
Soak chiles until softened, about ½ hour.
Drain the bowl, keeping 1 cup of soaking water.

2. Put the chiles, sugar, lime juice, and ¼ cup of the saved soaking water into a blender.
Blend the chile mixture into a smooth paste, adding soaking water as needed.

3. Season the pork shoulder generously with salt and pepper.
Rub the paste over the pork evenly.

4. Heat oil in a large dutch oven over medium heat.
Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, oregano, coriander, cumin, and allspice.
Cook, stirring often until onion is soft, roughly 8 min.
Add beer and bring to a boil.
Add pork to pot and cover.
Move pot to oven.

5. Bake pot in oven until pork is very tender, about 2½ hours.

6. Move pot to heat and uncover.
Simmer over medium, and let the excess braise to cook off, about 1½ hours.
Add lime juice to pot when the braise is almost cooked off.
Cook until the shoulder has browned.
Shred the shoulder using 2 forks.
