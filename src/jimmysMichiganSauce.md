DAD'S MICHIGAN SAUCE
====================

This is my Dad's Michigan Sauce.
[Michigans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_hot_dog) are a North Country, New York thing.
My dad says this recipe is from Otis's, the original sellers in Plattsburgh.
It could be as close to the original 'sauced' variation of Michigan sauce as you can get.

I assure you, they are a serious cultural matter and I will fight you if you do not steam them or use red hot franks (I prefer Glazier's of Malone).

_Makes enough sauce for a dozen hot dogs_

Parts
-----

- 2 lb ground beef, preferably chuck, 85/15
- 2 cup yellow onion _or_ white onion, chopped _or_ minced
- 1 cup white onion, diced small
- 2 teaspoon cumin, ground
- 2 teaspoon chili powder
- 2 teaspoon cayenne powder
- 2 tablespoons yellow mustard
- 2 tablespoons tomato ketchup
- 4 oz tomato paste
- 4 oz olive oil

Cook
----

1. Heat a large skillet to medium-low heat.
Add olive oil and heat evenly.
Add chopped or minced onions and saut√© until clear.
Stir often to avoid caramelization.
Strain the oil into a small bowl.
Put the onions in a medium bowl.

2. Take the skillet off the heat.
Set heat to low.
Add the ground beef to the skillet and let rest until the sizzling stops.
Return the skillet to heat.
Brown the meat slowly, pulling it apart to ensure even cooking.
Season with salt and pepper.

3. When meat is evenly browned, cook off excess water.
Stew meat slowly in its fat until meat is very tender.
Add oil from onions if the meat begins to dry.

4. Add spices to the meat and mix well.
Add seasoning to taste.

5. Stir in mustard and ketchup and tomato paste.
Mix well and continue to stew, stirring occasionally.
When the vinegar has cooked out of the mustard, add onions to meat.
Mix sauce well.
Remove sauce from heat when well blended.

Serve
-----

Boil hot dogs and steam half-stale, top-loading buns.
Add hot dog to bun and top with sauce.

Serve diced onions under the sauce (buried), on top (with), or without.
Top with yellow mustard.
Ketchup is forbidden.
