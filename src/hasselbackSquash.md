HASSELBACK SQUASH
=================

A spicy but delicious squash dish fit for the center of the table.
Use real syrup here, but the quality does not have to be high.

_8 servings_

Parts
-----

- 1 large butternut squash or 2-3 small Honeynut squash (about 3 lbs. total)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 Fresno chili, thinly sliced
- ¼ cup maple syrup, preferably grade B (this is getting baked)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 6-8 dried bay leaves

Prep
----

1. Place a rack in the middle of a modern convection oven or in the upper third for a normal oven. 
Preheat oven to 425℉.

2. Halve the squash lengthwise and scoop out seeds.
Skin the squash and any cut away white pith, but do not cut away deep orange flesh.

3. Rub the squash with oil and season with salt and pepper.
Place in a baking dish large enough to hold the two halves side-by-side.

Cook
----

1. Roast squash until squash is softened.
When soft, you should be able to **easily** stab the squash about ¼" with a table fork.
This should take roughly a quarter hour.

2. While roasting squash, put chile, maple syrup, butter, and vinegar in a small saucepan.
Bring saucepan to medium-high heat.
Stir the mixture now-and-then until thick enough to coat a spoon.
You can remove the chile when spicy to taste at any time, but do not toss the chile.
When the sauce glazes a spoon, reduce heat to very low and keep glaze warm.

3. Move squash to a cutting board and let cool.
Using a sharp knife, score the round sides of the squash halves crosswise.
Go as deep as you can without cutting all the way through the squash.
Move squash back to baking dish, scored sides up.
Tuck bay leaves in between some of the slices (at random).
Season with salt and pepper.

4. Roast squash (more). 
Baste the squash with the glaze every 10 minutes.
Use a pastry brush to lift any glaze in the dish that is browning.
Roast and glaze until the squash is tender and the glaze is rich and brown.
This takes about an hour.

Serve
-----

Place the glazed squash onto a platter and top with the reserved chiles.
