<h1 id="braised-beef-and-bacon">BRAISED BEEF AND BACON</h1>
<p>A braised stew of chuck and bacon. <strong>A dutch oven or heavy, oven-proof pot is needed.</strong></p>
<p><em>4 servings</em></p>
<h2 id="parts">Parts</h2>
<ul>
<li>750 mL red wine</li>
<li>2½ lb boneless beef chuck or bottom roast</li>

<li>4 large sprigs thyme</li>
<li>2 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prep">Prep</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Preheat oven to 300℉.</p></li>

<h2 id="serve">Serve</h2>
<p>Ladle stew into a bowl. Rub slices of crusty bread with remaining clove of garlic. Serve with bread.</p>
<h1 id="bernies-vinegar-chicken">BERNIE’S VINEGAR CHICKEN</h1>
<p>This is a variation on the grilled chicken recipe from a famous Brooklyn eatery: <a href="https://www.berniesnyc.com/">Bernie’s Restaurant</a></p>
<p><em>Per dozen-weight of chicken or turkey</em></p>
<h2 id="rub">Rub</h2>
<ul>
<li>6 tablespoons sea flake <em>or</em> 3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
<li>3 tablespoons paprika, ground</li>
<li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon black peppercorn, ground</li>
<li>1 ¼ teaspoons cinnamon, ground</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sauce">Sauce</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 cups of sherry or red wine vinegar</li>
<li>2 Fresno or Jalapeño chiles, thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter to add</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prep-1">Prep</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Spatchcock a whole chicken.</li>
<li>Mix the dry rub ingredients together.</li>
<li>Dry-brine the bird with the rub for at least 12 hours.</li>
<li>In a medium mixing bowl, add vinegar, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and salt.</li>
<li>Prepare a charcoal grill. Lightly oil the grilling grate. Place your hand 1 foot above the coals, palm down. You should aim to keep your hand in the heat for 8-12 seconds. Maintain this temperature throughout the cook; set the grate to this height.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cook-1">Cook</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Grill the bird with legs facing the flames, skin up, and cover. Every 20 minutes, baste the bird with the vinegar sauce.</li>
<li>After 1 hour and 20 minutes, check the temperature: 160℉ in the thickest part of the thigh and 140℉ in the breast.</li>
<li>Baste the bird once more, then flip skin down and bring closer to the flames. Cook until skin is crispy, roughly 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from grill and let rest on cutting board for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Put remaining sauce into a thick-bottomed sauce pan and simmer, melting 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Reduce and thicken the sauce.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="serve-1">Serve</h2>
<p>Portion the bird into parts and slice. Spoon the sauce over the bird before serving.</p>
<h1 id="springy-hot-and-sour-soup">SPRINGY HOT AND SOUR SOUP</h1>
<p>This is a quick hot and sour soup base. I would recommend you add broth vice water.</p>
<p><em>4 servings</em></p>
<h2 id="parts-1">Parts</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
<li>6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 2” piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 tablespoons miso</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>4 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Aleppo-style pepper <em>or</em> ½ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ cup shiitake <em>or</em> crimini mushrooms, trimmed, thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 cups peas</li>
<li>2 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium. Add garlic and ginger. Cook, stirring often, until softened and very fragrant. Add 3 cups water <em>or</em> chicken broth.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine miso and 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl and mix. Add miso, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and pepper. Heat to medium-high and simmer. Keep pot at simmer and cook until flavors come together.</p></li>
<li><p>Add mushrooms and peas and cook until crisp-tender. Gently stir in egg and cook until just set, about 30 seconds. Season with salt.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="serve-2">Serve</h2>
<p>Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle with more chili if desired.</p>
<h1 id="hasselback-squash">HASSELBACK SQUASH</h1>
<p>A spicy but delicious squash dish fit for the center of the table. Use real syrup here, but the quality does not have to be high.</p>
<p><em>8 servings</em></p>
<h2 id="parts-2">Parts</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 large butternut squash or 2-3 small Honeynut squash (about 3 lbs. total)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 Fresno chili, thinly sliced</li>
<li>¼ cup maple syrup, preferably grade B (this is getting baked)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>6-8 dried bay leaves</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prep-2">Prep</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Place a rack in the middle of a modern convection oven or in the upper third for a normal oven. Preheat oven to 425℉.</p></li>
<li><p>Halve the squash lengthwise and scoop out seeds. Skin the squash and any cut away white pith, but do not cut away deep orange flesh.</p></li>
<li><p>Rub the squash with oil and season with salt and pepper. Place in a baking dish large enough to hold the two halves side-by-side.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cook-2">Cook</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Roast squash until squash is softened. When soft, you should be able to <strong>easily</strong> stab the squash about ¼&quot; with a table fork. This should take roughly a quarter hour.</p></li>
<li><p>While roasting squash, put chile, maple syrup, butter, and vinegar in a small saucepan. Bring saucepan to medium-high heat. Stir the mixture now-and-then until thick enough to coat a spoon. You can remove the chile when spicy to taste at any time, but do not toss the chile. When the sauce glazes a spoon, reduce heat to very low and keep glaze warm.</p></li>
<li><p>Move squash to a cutting board and let cool. Using a sharp knife, score the round sides of the squash halves crosswise. Go as deep as you can without cutting all the way through the squash. Move squash back to baking dish, scored sides up. Tuck bay leaves in between some of the slices (at random). Season with salt and pepper.</p></li>
<li><p>Roast squash (more). Baste the squash with the glaze every 10 minutes. Use a pastry brush to lift any glaze in the dish that is browning. Roast and glaze until the squash is tender and the glaze is rich and brown. This takes about an hour.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="serve-3">Serve</h2>
<p>Place the glazed squash onto a platter and top with the reserved chiles.</p>
<h1 id="dads-michigan-sauce">DAD’S MICHIGAN SAUCE</h1>
<p>This is my Dad’s Michigan Sauce. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_hot_dog">Michigans</a> are a North Country, New York thing. My dad says this recipe is from Otis’s, the original sellers in Plattsburgh. It could be as close to the original ‘sauced’ variation of Michigan sauce as you can get. The truest exploration of a Michigan came from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/07/what-is-the-michigan-hot-dog-new-york-state-adirondacks.html">Serious Eats</a>. I assure you, they are a serious cultural matter and I will fight you if you do not steam them or use red hot franks.</p>
<p><em>Makes enough sauce for a dozen hot dogs</em></p>
<h2 id="parts-3">Parts</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 lb ground beef, preferably chuck, 85/15</li>
<li>2 cup yellow onion <em>or</em> white onion, chopped <em>or</em> minced</li>
<li>1 cup white onion, diced small</li>
<li>2 teaspoon cumin, ground</li>
<li>2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoon cayenne powder</li>
<li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
<li>2 tablespoons tomato ketchup</li>
<li>4 oz tomato paste</li>
<li>4 oz olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cook-3">Cook</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Heat a large skillet to medium-low heat. Add olive oil and heat evenly. Add chopped or minced onions and sauté until clear. Stir often to avoid caramelization. Strain the oil into a small bowl. Put the onions in a medium bowl.</li>
<li>Take the skillet off the heat. Set heat to low. Add the ground beef to the skillet and let rest until the sizzling stops. Return the skillet to heat. Brown the meat slowly, pulling it apart to ensure even cooking. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>When meat is evenly browned, cook off excess water. Stew meat slowly in its fat until meat is very tender. Add oil from onions if the meat begins to dry.</li>
<li>Add spices to the meat and mix well. Add seasoning to taste.</li>
<li>Stir in mustard and ketchup and tomato paste. Mix well and continue to stew, stirring occasionally. When the vinegar has cooked out of the mustard, add onions to meat. Mix sauce well. Remove sauce from heat when well blended.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="serve-4">Serve</h2>
<p>Boil hot dogs and steam half-stale, top-loading buns. Add hot dog to bun and top with sauce.</p>
<p>Serve diced onions under the sauce (buried), on top (with), or without. Top with yellow mustard. Ketchup is forbidden.</p>
